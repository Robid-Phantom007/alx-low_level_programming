# Project on Hash Tables

## General
* What is a hash function
* What makes a good hash function
* What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
* What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
* What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
* What are the most common use cases of hash tables

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are allowed to use the C standard library
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called hash_tables.h
* Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
